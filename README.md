# Customer Churn Prediction & Revenue Risk Analysis (Python)

A complete **end-to-end churn prediction project** built fully in **Python**, including:
- ✔ Synthetic telecom dataset (created programmatically)
- ✔ Machine learning model to predict customer churn
- ✔ Risk segmentation (Low / Medium / High)
- ✔ Expected revenue loss for each customer
- ✔ Feature importance report (what drives churn)

This project is designed to be **simple**, **business-focused**, and **easy to understand**, even for non-technical people.

##  Why This Project Is Unique
Most churn projects use Kaggle data.  
**This one generates its own dataset** with realistic business rules — making it 100% original.

It shows:
- Your ability to **think like a Data Analyst**
- Your skills in **Python, ML, and business logic**
- Your capability to build something **from scratch**

This impresses recruiters more than a standard Kaggle notebook.
